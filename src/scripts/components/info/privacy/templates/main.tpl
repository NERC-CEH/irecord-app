    <p><strong>Use of your name</strong></p>

    <p>If you choose to create a user account for the app, this will be created on the
      <a href="http://irecord.org.uk" rel="external">Biological Record Centre's iRecord system</a>.
      This enables you to log in and see your records and those submitted by other people for all
      species. Your name, as specified when you create the account, will appear next to your
      records and will be viewable by other users of iRecord.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>E-mail address</strong></p>

    <p>To create an account you will need to supply your e-mail address, which will be used in order
      to validate your account and to send you periodic updates and important information about the
      project. Your email address will not be shown and disseminated with your records but will be
      available to the verifying experts if they need to contact you about your sightings. You are
      able to delete your iRecord account or opt out of receiving emails at any time.</p>
