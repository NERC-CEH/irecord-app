                  Tap here to add your record. You will first be asked to give
                  the name of the species you are recording, and then you can
                  add the other record information.

                  Tap here to start a new record by adding a photo first, and
                  then completing the species name and other details. The app
                  provides image recognition that may be able to help suggest an
                  identification for your species photo – once your photo has
                  been added you can tap on it to see the suggested
                  identifications. It is also possible to add extra photos of
                  your species.

                  Tap here to select multiple photos from your gallery and add
                  them to a single record. In this case the image recognition
                  will provide a single suggested identification based on all
                  the photos – tap on any one photo to see the suggestions, or
                  tap on the “Species missing” button. Once you have agreed an
                  ID and added the other details you can save the record with
                  all the photos attached.

                  Tap here to see the other survey options in the app. These
                  allow you to add a list of records from the same site on the
                  same date. Currently there are three options:
                </p>
                <ul className="my-2 list-disc pl-4">
                  <li>
                    Plant List Survey (e.g. to record a list of species in a
                    grid square)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Moth List Survey (e.g. for recording moths at a moth trap)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Species List Survey (e.g. for recording a range of different
                    species on one date)
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  Records in the list will be linked to the overall location for
                  the survey. For the Plant List and Species List surveys you
                  can choose to “Geolocate list entries”. If you switch that on,
                  the app will add a precise GPS location to each individual
                  record in your list. Be careful not to leave this switched on
                  if you are adding records from a different location (e.g. if
                  you leave your survey site and then want to add more records
                  after you have arrive home).
                </p>

                  If you have added a photo to your record, the app will offer
                  suggestions about the identification (ID), using automatic
                  image recognition.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After uploading a photo, check the thumbnail to see if it
                  shows a coloured circle indicating the probability of a
                  suggested ID. This uses ‘traffic light’ colours to suggest how
                  confident the app is about the suggested ID:
                </p>
                <ul className="my-2">
                  <li>
                    <div className="-mb-1 inline-block size-4 rounded-full bg-success" />{' '}
                    = high confidence

                    <div className="-mb-1 inline-block size-4 rounded-full bg-warning-400" />{' '}
                    = medium confidence

                  <li>
                    <div className="-mb-1 inline-block size-4 rounded-full bg-danger" />{' '}
                    = low confidence
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  If you have already suggested an ID, and the image recognition
                  suggests a different ID, a small red warning circle will be
                  displayed – open the thumbnail or edit the species name to see
                  the alternative ID suggestion.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Example of an ID that the image recognition agrees with, and
                  has high confidence:

                <p>
                  When you open up the thumbnail image you can tap on the
                  “Suggestions” button to see the suggested ID, and you can then
                  tap on “Select” to set the identification for your record.

                  When you add a record to the app and then upload it to
                  iRecord, it may be checked by one of the expert verifiers who
                  volunteer on behalf of the national or local wildlife
                  recording schemes. If that happens you will see notifications
                  in the app to tell you that the record has been accepted or
                  not.
                </T>
              </p>
              <p>
                <T>
                  Some verifiers may have added additional comments or queries
                  to your records, and at the moment these are not available
                  within the app, so you may wish to log on to the iRecord
                  website and view your records and notifications there.

              <p>
                <T>
                  If you do not wish to see the notifications in the app you can
                  tick the box for “Do not show again”, but if you do this the
                  notifications will become unavailable unless you reset the app
                  settings or reinstall the app.
