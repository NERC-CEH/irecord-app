      How to make a new record
    </a>
    <p id="c1" class="collapse"
       aria-labelledby="headingOne" aria-expanded="false">
      There are two ways to start a record.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Taking a photo</strong>
      <br>
      Press the camera button <span class="icon icon-camera"></span> in the home
      page header. This will prompt you to select the photo source: camera or gallery.
      Once you have picked a photo, the app will create a new record without any
      species associated with it.
      Clicking on the newly created record will open the taxa search page.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Selecting species</strong>
      <br>
      Please press the plus <span class="icon icon-plus"></span> button in the home page header.
      This will bring you to the taxa search page. After selecting the species,
      open the record (either by opening it directly from the taxa search page
      using the edit button <span class="icon edit"></span> beside the species name or through
      the home-list page) and fill in the details of the sighting, like location,
      date, number seen etc.
      <br>
      <br>
      When finished, set for submission by pressing the paper plane
      <span class="icon icon-send"></span> button
    </p>
  </li>
  <li class="table-view-cell">
    <a class="collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion"
       href="#c2" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="c2">
      <span class="icon icon-collapse pull-left"></span>
      Searching for species
    </a>
    <p id="c2" class="collapse"
       aria-labelledby="headingOne" aria-expanded="false">
      The application holds all of the UK’s species (70000+) and all the associated taxonomy ranks.
      For quicker searching of the taxa you can use different shortcuts.
      For example, to find <i>Puffinus puffinus</i> you can type in the search bar:
      <br>
      <br><i>puf puf</i>
      <br><i>p puf</i>
      <br><i>p .nus</i>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li class="table-view-cell">

      Sync. with iRecord
    </a>
    <p id="c3" class="collapse"
       aria-labelledby="headingTwo" aria-expanded="false">
      All your saved records will be shown on the home page.
      By default a record is in <i>draft</i> mode until it is set for submission.
      While it is in <i>draft</i> mode the application will not synchronise your
      record with the database. To set it for sending,
      open the record and press the <span class="icon icon-send"></span> button in the header.
      The application will try to submit your record once there is a good network
      connection.

      If the record has reached the database a red
      <span class="icon icon-send" style="color: red;"></span>(set for submission & saved locally)
      will become green <span class="icon icon-send" style="color: green;"></span>
      (synced to the database). Once it has successfully reached
      the database the record becomes unavailable for new edits.
      To further edit it
      please use the <a href="http://irecord.org.uk">iRecord Website</a>.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Note:</b> you have to be signed in to your iRecord account and have a network connection,
      for the records to be automatically synchronised in the background.

      You can also delete all the locally saved records that have been

      Lock an attribute
    </a>
    <p id="locks" class="collapse"
       aria-labelledby="headingTwo" aria-expanded="false">
      You can lock record attributes like date, location, number etc, which will
      preserve your current attribute value for the subsequently added records.
      <br>
      To lock an attribute click on the lock <span class="icon icon-lock-open"></span>
      button in the attribute edit page header. This will change the symbol to
      locked <span class="icon icon-lock-closed"></span> both on the button and next to the attribute.
      <br><br>
      Note: locations acquired through GPS can not be locked. Also, running the GPS on a record
      that has a locked location will overwrite the location with the newly acquired GPS position
      but will not overwrite the existing lock, so subsequent records will still
      have the initially locked location.
